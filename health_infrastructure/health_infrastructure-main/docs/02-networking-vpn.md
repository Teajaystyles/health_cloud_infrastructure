# Client VPN Endpoint Setup

## Overview

The setup of the Client VPN endpoint in AWS involves generating certificates using easy-rsa, uploading these certificates to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), and configuring the VPN endpoint to secure and manage access to the AWS network.

## Certificate Generation and Management

### Server and Root Certificates

The process begins with the generation of server certificates using easy-rsa, a CLI utility for building and managing a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). Using easy-rsa, we generate the server certificates that are critical for the security of the VPN connection. These certificates are then uploaded to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) under the domain `vpn.tijesuniabraham.com`, ensuring they are managed securely and are readily available for the VPN configuration.

Additionally, we utilize ACM to generate a root certificate for the domain `vpn.tijesuniabraham.com`. This root certificate serves as a trusted certificate authority (CA) that will validate the legitimacy of certificates used during the VPN connection.

### User Certificates

For user-specific certificates, we run the following easy-rsa command:

```
./easyrsa build-client-full abraham.vpn.tijesuniabraham.com nopass
```

This command generates a client certificate for the user `abraham`, which is used to authenticate the user on the VPN without requiring a password. This simplifies the process for users while maintaining a high level of security.

## VPN Configuration and Integration

### Association with Private Subnets

The VPN is configured to be associated with private subnets within the VPC. This setup ensures that all traffic routed through the VPN is securely directed to these subnets, which contain the resources that the VPN users need to access.

### Internal Load Balancer Configuration

To further enhance security and traffic management, an internal load balancer is configured to accept traffic only from the Client VPN endpoint's security group. This setup restricts access to the load balancer, ensuring that only traffic coming through the VPN can reach the backend services hosted within the private subnets. This configuration not only secures the services but also optimizes the handling of incoming traffic, distributing it efficiently across the available resources.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive setup provides a secure and efficient way to manage remote access to AWS resources. By leveraging easy-rsa for certificate management and integrating tightly with AWS services like ACM and VPC, we ensure a robust infrastructure that supports both security and accessibility.
